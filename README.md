# Extraction-of-Music-note-
Audio Note Extraction and Analysis
This repository contains a set of Python scripts for extracting musical notes from audio files, analyzing the frequency components, and visualizing the waveform in real time. The code is a Python adaptation of MATLAB functions.

Copy code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py             # Main program for audio note extraction and frequency analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FreqToNote.py       # Function to map frequencies to musical notes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plotsound.py        # Function to play and plot the audio signal in real-time
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FurElise_Slow.mp3   # Sample input audio file (optional)

üöÄ How It Works
1.	main.py:
o	Reads an audio file and analyzes a specific window of the song.
o	Uses FFT to extract frequency components and down-sample the audio.
o	Applies a moving threshold to detect musical notes.
o	Recreates the song using detected fundamental frequencies.
2.	FreqToNote.py:
o	Converts a given frequency to its corresponding musical note using logarithmic mapping.
o	Returns both the note and the closest frequency.
3.	plotsound.py:
o	Plays the audio while plotting the waveform in real time.
o	Simulates real-time audio visualization with matplotlib and sounddevice.

Usage
1.	Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-note-extraction.git
cd audio-note-extraction
2.	Run the Main Script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
3.	Sample Usage of FreqToNote.py:
python
Copy code
from FreqToNote import FreqToNote

note, freq = FreqToNote(440)
print(f"Note: {note}, Frequency: {freq} Hz")  # Output: Note: A4, Frequency: 440 Hz
4.	Visualize and Play Audio:
python
Copy code
from plotsound import plotsound
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav

Fs, y = wav.read('FurElise_Slow.wav')
plotsound(y, Fs)

Features
‚Ä¢	Extract and recreate musical notes from any audio file.
‚Ä¢	Detect fundamental frequencies using FFT.
‚Ä¢	Visualize audio signals dynamically while playing them.
‚Ä¢	Identify musical notes based on frequency mappings.

Input Files
‚Ä¢	FurElise_Slow.mp3:
o	A sample audio file provided for testing.
o	You can replace it with your own .wav or .mp3 file.
________________________________________
Troubleshooting
‚Ä¢	If you encounter issues with audio playback, ensure the sounddevice library is properly installed and your audio device is configured.
‚Ä¢	If using a .wav file as input, ensure it is in the correct format (int16 or float32).
